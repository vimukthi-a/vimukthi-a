# Greetings fellow traveler 🧭

I'm a student who loves coding and building things. I enjoy web development and software engineering, and I'm currently diving deep into machine learning — working on prediction apps and other projects to learn as I go.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym, mixing and matching my spotify playlist 🎵 or gaming while sipping on my karak ☕ 

*P.S I also love Formula 1 🏎️*

Always exploring, always learning.
