# Hey there! 👋

I'm a student who loves coding and building things. I enjoy web development and software engineering, and I'm currently diving deep into machine learning — working on prediction apps and other projects to learn as I go.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym or mix and matching my spotify playlist 🎵

Always exploring, always learning.
